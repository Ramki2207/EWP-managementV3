4. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - Go to Site settings â†’ Environment variables
   - Add the following variables from your `.env` file:
     ```
     VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://zgcbynprsfbhnskarxnp.supabase.co
     VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6InpnY2J5bnByc2ZiaG5za2FyeG5wIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NDc5OTAxODAsImV4cCI6MjA2MzU2NjE4MH0.qen3uxz0Tm03SBlVOG_ks61qbAmCpr5vvDcuPyoTzwI

   npm install -g netlify-cli
   ```

2. **Login to Netlify**

   ```

## ðŸ”§ Post-Deployment Configuration

### 1. Update DNS Settings for ewp-management.nl

Configure your domain DNS settings to point to Netlify:

- **A Record**: Point to Netlify's load balancer IP (provided by Netlify)
- **CNAME Record**: Point `www` to your Netlify subdomain

Netlify will provide specific DNS settings in the dashboard.

### 2. Verify SSL Certificate

- Netlify automatically provisions SSL certificates via Let's Encrypt
- Wait 1-2 minutes after DNS configuration
- Verify HTTPS is working: https://ewp-management.nl

### 3. Test Client Portal Links

- The client portal URLs will now use the production domain
- Format: `https://ewp-management.nl/client-portal/{access-code}`
- Test document downloads to ensure storage access works

### 4. Update Supabase Allowed Origins (if needed)

If you encounter CORS issues:

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings â†’ API
3. Under "Site URL", add: `https://ewp-management.nl`
4. Under "Additional Redirect URLs", add: `https://ewp-management.nl/**`

## ðŸ“‹ Continuous Deployment (Optional)

To enable automatic deployments when you push changes:

1. **Connect Git Repository**
   - In Netlify dashboard: Site settings â†’ Build & deploy
   - Link your GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket repository

2. **Configure Build Settings**
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
   - These are already configured in `netlify.toml`

3. **Enable Auto-Deploy**
   - Netlify will automatically build and deploy on every push to main branch
